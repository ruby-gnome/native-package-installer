# native-package-installer 

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/native-package-installer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/native-package-installer)

Users need to install native packages to install an extension library
that depends on native packages. It bores users because users need to
install native packages and an extension library separately.
native-package-installer helps to install native packages on "gem install".
Users can install both native packages and an extension library by one action,
"gem install".
